- When starting, the buttons for the path finding are shown despite no begin/end nodes beeing selected
- `Display what are the X Y Z axis of the hyperdimensions just above the Axis representation`
- Cannot move the edit X,Y,Z window that appears when editing a node
- When moving a node, should show the coordinates on the screen (not sure where would be good)
