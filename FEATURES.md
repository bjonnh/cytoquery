- Visualize a graph of obsidian notes in 3d
- Select nodes and display a green halo
- Show a circular menu when a node is clicked that allows to:
  - Open the node in a new tab (üìÑ)
  - Lock/unlock the node in place (üîí/üîì)
  - Set the node as start point for path finding (üéØ)
  - Set the node as end point for path finding (üèÅ)
  - Center the camera on that node with adjustable distance (üëÅÔ∏è)
  - Restrict the graph to show only neighbors within a specified depth (üîç)
  - Remove all restrictions (‚Ü©Ô∏è) - appears when restrictions are active
- Circular menu features:
  - Radial layout with icons positioned in a circle around the click point
  - Smooth animations for menu items appearing
  - Central display showing the node name
  - Hover effects and visual feedback
  - Sub-dialogs for advanced options (center distance, neighbor depth)
  - Draggable menu and dialogs - drag by clicking on the center node or dialog title
  - Automatic bounds checking to keep menu and dialogs within screen
- Show a shortest link between two nodes. User can set start/end nodes via circular menu
  - User can then choose directional travel or any direction (doesn't care which way the edge goes)
- Parameters are editable and are saved in the text of the source element
- Nodes can be locked in place (and this is persisted if the user press save)
  - Locked nodes display visual indicators with 4 animated gold arrows pointing inward
  - Arrows oscillate back and forth along their axis to draw attention
- Idle rotation mode with toggle button and camera orbit functionality
- Restriction center visual effect:
  - When graph is restricted to show neighbors, the center node displays a transparent pulsing sphere
  - Glass-like material with adjustable transparency and transmission
  - Breathing scale animation and opacity pulsing
  - Subtle color shifting between purple and pink
  - Inner glow sphere for depth effect
  - Effect automatically appears when restriction is applied and disappears when removed
- FPS limiter toggle button (‚ö°):
  - Toggle between performance-optimized mode (1 FPS when idle) and full 60 FPS mode
  - When disabled, forces the graph to maintain 60 FPS continuously
  - Visual feedback with red tint when FPS limiter is disabled
  - Useful for smooth idle rotation or when consistent frame rate is desired
- GitHub CI/CD Pipeline:
  - Automated builds and tests on push and pull requests
  - Creates release artifacts (main.js, manifest.json, styles.css) when tags are pushed
  - Generates bundled zip file for easy plugin installation
  - Automatic GitHub releases with generated release notes
- Interactive Demo Page:
  - Standalone demo showcasing plugin features without Obsidian
  - Automatically deployed to GitHub Pages on main branch updates
  - Sample graph with 50 nodes and randomized connections
  - Interactive controls for graph manipulation
  - Real-time FPS counter and statistics display
  - Demonstrates node selection, camera controls, and visual effects
- Platform Abstraction Layer:
  - Core graph logic isolated from Obsidian dependencies via GraphPlatformAdapter interface
  - Enables code reuse between Obsidian plugin and standalone demo
  - Clean separation of concerns with platform-specific implementations
  - Simplified maintenance and testing of graph functionality
- Enhanced Query Language with Tag Support:
  - Tag nodes are now included in the graph visualization (displayed as #tagname)
  - `tag("tagname")` selector matches tag nodes themselves
  - `tagged("tagname")` selector matches pages/notes that have the specified tag
  - `"node name"` selector allows styling specific nodes by their exact name
  - Tag nodes are connected to all pages that use them
  - Supports both inline tags (#tag) and frontmatter tags
  - Case-insensitive matching for tags and node names
- Hyperdimensional Node Positioning:
  - Define custom spatial systems (e.g., "Time", "Geography", "Concepts")
  - Create axes within spatial systems with optional min/max bounds
  - Map any axis to the 3D graph's X, Y, or Z dimensions
  - Position nodes independently on each axis (nodes can be locked in some dimensions while free in others)
  - UI panel (üìê) for managing spatial systems and axes:
    - Create/delete spatial systems and axes
    - Real-time axis mapping selectors
    - Visual organization by spatial system
  - Node position editor in circular menu:
    - Edit positions for all defined axes
    - Unlock nodes in specific dimensions
    - Respects axis bounds when setting values
  - Full persistence of hyperdimension data in code blocks
  - Backward compatible with legacy locked nodes system
- Centered Top Button Layout:
  - All control buttons are now centered at the top of the graph view
  - Responsive flexbox layout that maintains center alignment
  - Menu button remains in the top-right corner for consistency
  - Clean, organized appearance with consistent spacing between buttons
