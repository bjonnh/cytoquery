- Visualize a graph of obsidian notes in 3d
- Select nodes and display a green halo
- Show a window when a node is selected that allows to:
  - Center on that node
  - Restrict to nodes linked to that node with a distance
- Show a shortest link between two nodes. User click on blue button then start node then orange button then end node
  - User can then choose directional travel or any direction (doesn't care which way the edge goes)
- Parameters are editable and are saved in the text of the source element
- Nodes can be locked in place (and this is persisted if the user press save)
